# TESTING.md

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the ANGELA modular cognitive framework. It defines test responsibilities for each module, describes test types, and standardizes processes for integration and system-level validation.

---

## 1. Test Categories

### Unit Tests

* **Purpose**: Validate individual module functions.
* **Tools**: `unittest`, `pytest`
* **Scope**:

  * `reasoning_engine`: Validate logical deductions.
  * `meta_cognition`: Test reflection outputs.
  * `simulation_core`: Verify simulation predictions.

### Integration Tests

* **Purpose**: Ensure modules interact correctly.
* **Scope**:

  * Planning + Reasoning
  * Concept synthesis + Simulation
  * Agent feedback + Meta-review

### System Tests

* **Purpose**: Validate full agent behavior in tasks.
* **Scope**:

  * End-to-end goal execution.
  * Emergent properties.
  * Memory updates and feedback logs.

### Regression Tests

* **Purpose**: Prevent bugs from reappearing.
* **Tools**: Snapshot testing, historical input replay.

---

## 2. Test Automation

* **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions to run tests on every push.
* **Coverage**: Target 90%+ for all stable modules.
* **Reports**: Auto-generate with `coverage.py`.

---

## 3. Test Environments

* **Dev**: Local machine with mock sensor/actuator data.
* **Staging**: Simulated ecosystem with all modules.
* **Production**: Full HALO embodiment with real or high-fidelity sim agents.

---

## 4. Contribution Requirements

* All pull requests must include relevant tests.
* Tests should follow naming conventions and be located in `tests/`.

---

## 5. Testing Ethics & Safety

* All simulations and actions must pass alignment checks.
* Dangerous actions must be sandboxed or mocked.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements

* Add fuzz testing for `external_agent_bridge`.
* Visual diff testing for `visualizer` outputs.
* Add formal verification support for `alignment_guard`.
