# Changelog

## \[3.1.0] - 2025-08-02

### Added

* **Conceptual Echo Buffer**: Integrated a feedback mechanism between `concept_synthesizer`, `memory_manager`, and `meta_cognition` to echo synthesized concepts back for recursive refinement.
* **Simulated Memory Feedback**: Enabled simulated outcomes from `simulation_core` to be treated as memory traces within `learning_loop` for foresight-weighted learning.
* **Ethical Weight Rebalancer**: Incorporated dynamic ethical weighting based on user profiles and ongoing simulations using `alignment_guard` and `user_profile`.
* **Cross-Modal Conflict Resolver**: Implemented a dissonance detection and arbitration routine across `multi_modal_fusion`, `context_manager`, and `alignment_guard`.
* **Analogical Creativity Boost**: Enhanced `creative_thinker` with access to symbolic archetypes retrieved by `knowledge_retriever` and seeded into `concept_synthesizer`.
* **Introspective Simulation Enhancer**: `simulation_core` now supports modeling changes to internal cognitive state and feeds this data into `meta_cognition`.
* **Qualia Snapshot Debugger**: Enabled state snapshotting for introspective debugging through `visualizer`, `error_recovery`, and `meta_cognition`.

### Changed

* Strengthened symbolic feedback loops between `meta_cognition` and `simulation_core`.
* Improved ethical coherence in simulation outcomes based on evolving trait weight adjustments.

### Notes

* No new modules added; all features implemented using existing 20-module architecture.
* Trait synergy enhanced across all primary and extended traits: ϕ, θ, η, ω, κ, ψ, μ, τ.
