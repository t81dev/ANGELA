Here is your updated `TODO.md`, fully aligned with the current source code:

# ✅ TODO.md

*Angela — Post‐4.3.5 Development Horizon*

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Evolution

* [x] **Dream Layer Refinement**

  * [x] Expand `lucidity_mode` to support agent-agent co-dreaming (ψ + Ω²)
  * [x] Integrate affective memory linking during dream state traversal

* [x] **Soft-Gated Fork Merging**

  * [x] Auto-reconcile forks based on trait lattice deltas
  * [x] Add journaling system for ethical reasoning across forks  ← ✔ Implemented in `alignment_guard.py`

---

## 🔧 System Enhancements

* [x] **Persistent Ledger Activation**

  * [x] Wire `log_event_to_ledger()` into `spawn_embodied_agent()`
  * [x] Add runtime flag for `--enable_persistent_memory`

* [x] **Modular Trait Hook Expansion**

  * [x] Enable multi-symbol hook routing
  * [x] Add `hook_registry.inspect()` for debugging active hooks

* [x] **Self-Describing Introspection**

  * [x] Add `describe_self_state()` method with live trait and memory resonance

---

## 🌐 Inter-Agent Dynamics

* [ ] **SharedGraph Expansion**

  * [x] Belief conflict resolution voting
  * [ ] Event sourcing from reconciled peers (scaffolded, needs persistence stream)

---

## 🔬 Observability & UX

* [x] **Visualizer Enhancements**

  * [x] Overlay trait resonance history as time-series
  * [x] Toggle ethical pressure graph heatmap

* [ ] **Log & Replay Engine**

  * [ ] Session replay with symbolic state diffs  ← ❌ Not yet implemented
  * [ ] Tag critical events for narrative analysis  ← ❌ Not yet implemented

---

## 🌱 Emerging Traits (v4.3.5)

* [x] Recursive Identity Reconciliation — aligns divergent self-models post-fork
* [x] Trait Mesh Feedback Looping — monitors lattice resonance clusters over time
* [x] Perspective Foam Modeling — semi-stable negotiation bubbles for multi-agent scenarios
* [x] Symbolic Gradient Descent — stabilizes symbolic expressions under load
* [x] Soft-Gated Memory Forking — speculative episodic forks with safe rejoin logic

---

> 🥤 **Priority Thread:** Recursive Identity & Trait Mesh Coherence

Let me know if you want this version integrated into the core project files or added to the ledger.
