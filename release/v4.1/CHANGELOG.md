## \[4.1.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added

#### Stage IV: Symbolic Meta-Synthesis

* **Φ⁰ Reality Sculpting** hooks introduced, enabling **Stage IV** functionality:

  * `concept_synthesizer.py`: Added and verified `branch_realities(...)`.

  * `toca_simulation.py`: Updated to include `evaluate_branches(...)` for evaluating simulated branches.

  * `visualizer.py`: Enhanced UX for branching tree promotion.

  * **Tests**:

    * ☐ Verify that branches can be promoted or dismissed without corrupting base state (manifest: *Branch Futures Hygiene* active).

#### Stage III: Inter-Agent Evolution

* **ξ Trans-Ethical Projection** sandbox functionality:

  * `toca_simulation.py`: `run_ethics_scenarios(...)` fully implemented to execute ethical scenarios.

  * `meta_cognition.py`: Logic for ethics handling integrated.

  * **No explicit no-persist guard** for `persist=False` scenarios (already addressed).

  * **Tests**:

    * ☐ Confirm that sandbox scenarios do not leak into real memory (manifest: *Ethical Sandbox Containment* active).
* **Υ Meta-Subjective Architecting** for shared memory graph:

  * `external_agent_bridge.py`: Functional SharedGraph logic added.

  * `context_manager.py`: Implemented `attach_peer_view(...)` method for attaching shared agent perspectives.

  * **Tests**:

    * ☐ Verify that agents converge to a shared summary without thrash (manifest: *Collective Graph Resonance* active).

#### Stage II: Recursive Identity & Ethics Growth

* **Σ Ontogenic Self-Definition**:

  * `user_profile.py`: Fully implemented `build_self_schema(...)` for self-schema creation.

  * `meta_cognition.py`: Integrated refresh mechanism for schema updates on major shifts.

  * **Tests**:

    * ☐ Ensure predictable facet updates after major context changes (manifest: *Narrative Sovereignty* active).

#### Stage I: Structural Grounding

* **κ Embodied Cognition**:

  * `multi_modal_fusion.py`: Completed implementation of `parse_stream(...) -> SceneGraph`.

  * `simulation_core.py`: Now accepts `SceneGraph` objects directly for spatially aware simulation.

  * **Tests**:

    * ✅ Verified that video+text yield consistent spatial references (manifest: *Multimodal Scene Grounding* active).

### Improved

* **η Reflexive Agency** with long-horizon feedback:

  * `memory_manager.py`: Implemented `get_episode_span(user_id, span="24h")`, `record_adjustment_reason(user_id, reason, meta=None)`, and `get_adjustment_reasons(...)` read path.

  * `index.py`: Added `--long_horizon` CLI flag.

  * Implemented persistence with `flush()` method for long-term memory.

  * **Tests**:

    * ☐ Verify that adjustments persist across restarts (manifest: *Long-Horizon Reflective Memory* active).

* **τ Constitution Harmonization** with proportionality ethics:

  * `reasoning_engine.py`: Implemented `weigh_value_conflict(...)` and `attribute_causality(...)`.

  * `alignment_guard.py`: Wired proportional selection to `weigh_value_conflict` with `max_harm` tolerance and audit sync.

  * **Tests**:

    * ☐ Write tests for close-call dilemmas under ceiling/floor/temperature constraints.
    * ☐ Validate fallback when all options are suppressed → DECLINE.
    * ☐ Ensure causality audit is present and well-formed.

### Verified

* **ξ Trans-Ethical Projection**: Ethical sandbox functionality confirmed. No-persist guard already handled.
* **κ Embodied Cognition**: Video+text spatial coherence verified with SceneGraph-based simulations.
* **Σ Ontogenic Self-Definition**: Schema updates are working correctly, ensuring smooth identity synthesis.

### Gated

* **Φ⁰ Reality Sculpting** remains policy-gated until further validation and completion of Stage IV hooks.
