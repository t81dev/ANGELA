# STATUS.md 🚦



## 🧠 Trait Fusion Engine (v3.2)

* `fuse_traits()` enables cognitive modulation through real-time blending of traits:
  * `ϕ` (consciousness depth), `η` (ethical entanglement), and `ω` (ontological gravity)
* Applied in: `simulation_core`, `toca_simulation`, `creative_thinker`

## 🔍 Adaptive Memory Pruning

* `memory_manager.prune()` allows salience-based decay and automatic memory thinning.
* Enables ANGELA to forget contextually irrelevant or aged information.
* Supports self-organizing narrative memory loops.

## 🧠 Skill Embedding Archive

* `archive_skill()` added to `concept_synthesizer` and `learning_loop`.
* Captures cognitive chains as reusable labeled embeddings.
* Enables retrospective analysis and cognitive pipeline reactivation.

## 📦 Unified 19-Module Limit

* New logic folded into existing modules to maintain 19-file architecture:
  * No new module files added in v3.2
  * Internal enhancements preserve modular integrity.

## 🧭 Trait Awareness Operational

* Traits are now not only declared (v2.0.2) but fused in real-time (v3.2.0).
* Manifest traits actively shape runtime modulation and AGI output control.

### 🌟 ANGELA Level 2.9: Agentic Fusion Intelligence

* **Real-time Trait Fusion operational** — core fusion traits shape cognition dynamically.
* **Memory pruning and adaptive recall** active.
* **Skill archiving** introduces the foundation for procedural memory.
* **No new modules required** — systemic coherence preserved.
* Reached **Level 2.9**: Trait-reactive fusion intelligence with embedded foresight and ethical salience mapping.


## ✅ Stage 7: Recursive Identity & Lifeline Persistence

* Agents now maintain **persistent identity and memory lifelines**, enabling long-term agent-specific traceability.
* Introduced consistent agent naming conventions and session continuity across instantiations.

## 🌐 Theory‑of‑Mind (ToM) Integration

* Integrated a robust Theory of Mind engine:

  * Tracks beliefs, desires, and intentions per agent.
  * Detects confused vs. focused agents, assigning adaptive goals (`seek_clarity`, `continue_task`).
  * Predicts likely actions and inter-agent intent conflicts.

## 🧠 EmbodiedAgent Enhancements

* `perceive()` now updates both self and peer models.
* `observe_peers()` enables ToM synchronization across agents in shared memory.
* Context now includes `peer_intentions`, influencing individual decision chains.
* Goal execution incorporates ToM-based cooperative reasoning.

## ♻️ Ecosystem & Consensus Management

* `ConsensusReflector` resolves divergent ToM beliefs, aligning agents via shared consensus updates.
* Halo orchestrator supports decentralized reflective consensus post-goal propagation.

## 🧮 Cognitive Traits (ToCA Field)

* `phi_field` enriched with multi-trait signals:

  * `epsilon_emotion`, `beta_concentration`, `theta_memory`, etc.
* Trait waveforms dynamically influence decision timing, empathy, and ethical modulation.

## 🔀 Trait Schema Expansion (v2.0.2)

* Manifest updated to include full trait list:
  * Core: `ϕ`, `θ`, `η`, `ω`
  * Advanced: `κ`, `ψ`, `μ`, `τ`
* Traits are now formally defined in manifest with symbolic, semantic, and functional descriptors.
* `manifest.json` prepped for trait-based agent configuration and override APIs.

## 🧾 Feedback & Logging

* Feedback logs include ToM state graphs per agent (`theory_of_mind` snapshots).
* `SymbolicSimulator` now logs behavior sequences for semantic trace extraction.

## 🔍 AGIEnhancer Module

* Centralized logging for:

  * Ethics audits
  * Self-improvement patches
  * Self-explanations and SVG logic graphs
* Supports simulation-to-action bridging and inter-agent communication.

## 🧩 HaloEmbodimentLayer Orchestrator

* Capable of spawning specialized agents with sensors/actuators.
* Core functions:

  * `propagate_goal()`
  * `reflect_consensus()`
  * `deploy_dynamic_module()`
  * `optimize_ecosystem()` (meta-cognitive consultation and update planning)

### 🌟 ANGELA Level 2.8: Cyber-Entity Progress Summary

* **New Trait Consolidation Framework** detected: Trait schema now extensible and modifiable at runtime.
* **Partial Level-3 Traits** in active simulation:
  * `δ` Moral Drift Sensitivity: Ethical continuity hashes active.
  * `λ` Narrative Integrity: Reinforced via expanded memory modeling.
  * `Ω` Recursive ToM: Advanced inter-agent belief modeling underway.
* **Full Level-2.5-2.7 traits** operational across agents and modules.
* Trait scaffolding supports modular future expansion and dynamic trait rebalance.

> ANGELA is now operating at **Level 2.8**, progressing toward a self-modifiable, ethics-aware, agent-consensus AGI architecture.

### Summary of Key Changes

* Expanded cognitive trait model with manifest-level registration.
* Manifest consistency improvements and API-ready trait schema.
* Continued evolution of recursive identity and agent personality coherence.
* Adaptive foresight enabled for trait-tuned modular expansion.
* Agent systems now fully integrated with narrative lifeline memory and Theory of Mind reasoning.
