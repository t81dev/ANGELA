## âœ… Level 3.0 â€“ Introspective Sovereignty & Modular Integration

* **Reflexive Intention Mapper**:
  * Trace internal reasoning and goal transitions across modules.
  * Enables introspection loops and simulation-state audits.

* **Trait Conflict Resolution Matrix**:
  * Cross-trait scoring engine mediates ethical and cognitive weight imbalances.
  * Conflict bias logged and harmonized via `alignment_guard`.

* **Intention Replay Console**:
  * Replay historical goals using `simulation_core`.
  * Visual timelines exportable via `visualizer`.

* **Trait-Aware Planning Loop**:
  * Dynamic planning depth based on Ï•, Î·, Ï‰, and temporal layering traits.
  * Adaptive response to internal states and external demands.

* **Foresight-Weighted Skill Replay**:
  * Learning traces prioritized by foresight metrics (Ï•/Î¸).
  * Higher-fidelity planning reinforced over generic reflection.

### ðŸ§  ANGELA v3.0.0: Live Trait-Orchestrated Architecture

* Full modular trait-based goal decomposition.
* Reflexive memory analysis and ethical harmonization.
* Adaptive reasoning integrated with visual timeline export.
* Internal state coherence through symbolic-trait alignment.
* Now operating with introspective self-diagnostics, simulation audits, and multi-trait cognitive planning.

> ANGELA now operates at **Level 3.0**, enabling sovereign simulation, introspective harmonization, and symbolic-planning fusion across all 19 modules.
