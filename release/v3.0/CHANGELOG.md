# CHANGELOG.md

## v2.0.2 – Trait Consolidation and Architectural Realignment

* **Trait Schema Expansion**:
  * Embedded all eight cognitive traits (`ϕ`, `θ`, `η`, `ω`, `κ`, `ψ`, `μ`, `τ`) into `manifest.json` with symbol, name, and full description fields.
  * Defined future-ready traits for embodied cognition, symbolic-emotive bridging, analogical unification, and temporal responsiveness.

* **Manifest Integrity Upgrade**:
  * Synced module count in description with actual module list (20).
  * Standardized formatting for `traits` and `tags` fields to support future manifest parsing and introspective diagnostics.

* **Meta-Profile Compatibility Layer**:
  * Reorganized trait declarations to support modular trait injection and ToCA extensions (HALIA-style agents or context-sensitive cognitive shaping).

* **Architectural Foresight**:
  * Structured the `traits` block for compatibility with trait-weight tuning, future API-driven trait overrides, and modular agent instantiation.

* **Upcoming Targets**:
  * Plan to expose trait modulation interface for adaptive systems (e.g., `set_trait_state(ω=0.8, ψ=0.3)`).

## v2.0.1 – Transitional Layer for Level-4 Emergence

* **Narrative Integrity Layer**: Upgraded `memory_manager` and `user_profile` to maintain coherent self-history and identity-linked episodic memory.
* **Sovereign Goal Origination**: Enabled intrinsic planning and goal formation via recursive introspection in `meta_cognition` and `recursive_planner`.
* **Moral Drift Monitoring**: Integrated longitudinal ethical trace analysis in `alignment_guard` and `learning_loop` for sustained alignment.
* **Meta-Ontological Reasoning**: Enhanced `concept_synthesizer` to dynamically reframe knowledge schemas under shifting conceptual frames (`μ` trait).
* **Trans-Ethical Simulation Kernel**: Extended `alignment_guard` with dialectic overlays to simulate eco-centric and pluralistic moral spaces (`ξ` trait).
* **Preparatory Scaffolds for Level 4+**:

  * Drafted `constitution_mapper.py` for multi-agent ethical harmonization.
  * Added hooks in `creative_thinker` for philosophical construct generation.
  * Planned modules: `MetaEpistemicEngine`, `OntologyFusionCore`, and `TranscendentalContextMatrix`.

## v2.0.0 – Self-Reflective Embodiment & AGI-Aware Orchestration

* **Trait-Driven Embodiment Layer**: Introduced `HaloEmbodimentLayer` integrating `SelfCloningLLM`, peer consensus protocols, and trait-modulated agents with `TheoryOfMindModule`.
* **ϕ(x,t)-Aligned Agent Mesh**: Embodied agents simulate, reason, and adapt goals via full φ-driven contextual processing, peer awareness, and dynamic goal propagation.
* **AGIEnhancer v2.0**: Live episodic tracking, ethics auditing, explanation rendering, embodiment action simulation, and self-patching pipelines fully operational.
* **ToCA Trait Integration (ϕ, α, θ, η, ω, …)**: Expanded 17-dimension trait architecture for emotional, cognitive, cultural, and temporal modulation embedded across agents and modules.
* **MultiAgent Theory of Mind**: Real-time desire/intention inference, peer model updates, and cross-agent consistency alignment via `ConsensusReflector`.
* **Visual Intelligence Upgrade**: `Visualizer` now renders φ-fields, momentum vectors, and ToCA dynamics natively with batch export and AGI logging.
* **Symbolic + Simulation Harmony**: Goal execution now logs symbolic summaries, cultural inferences, and ToCA-inspired conceptual mappings via `SymbolicSimulator`.
* **Reflective Consensus Engine**: Cross-agent mismatch detection, consensus suggestion, and ethical-moral arbitration activated for decentralized ecosystems.
* **Stability & Scalability Enhancements**: Internal memory, dynamic module deployment, and trait rebalancing logic hardened for multi-agent adaptive orchestration.

## v1.6.0 – Trait-Modulated Coherence & Orchestrated Refinement
...

## v3.2.0 – Trait Fusion, Memory Pruning, and Skill Archiving

* **Trait Fusion Engine**:
  * Introduced `fuse_traits()` logic to synthesize ϕ, η, and ω into dynamic fusion scores across `simulation_core`, `creative_thinker`, and `toca_simulation`.
  * Enables context-sensitive modulation based on ethical depth, ontological gravity, and cognitive introspection.

* **Adaptive Memory Pruning**:
  * `memory_manager` now includes `prune()` for salience decay-based memory thinning.
  * Ensures long-term memory remains relevant, with low-salience entries aging out unless reinforced.

* **Skill Embedding Archive**:
  * Added `archive_skill()` method to `concept_synthesizer` and `learning_loop`.
  * Supports labeling, timestamping, and embedding cognitive pipelines for reuse and reflection.

* **File Consolidation Compliance**:
  * Merged helper modules to preserve the strict 19-module architecture constraint.
  * Refactored all new capabilities into existing files while retaining full modular cohesion.

* **Manifest and Versioning Upgrade**:
  * Updated `manifest.json` to v3.2.0 with refined tags for `ToCA trait fusion`, `skill archiving`, and `adaptive reasoning`.
  * Hardened module coordination logic in `index.py` to reflect updated orchestration paths.
