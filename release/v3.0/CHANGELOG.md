# CHANGELOG.md

## v3.0.0 – Introspective Sovereignty & Level 3 Modularity

* **Reflexive Intention Mapping**:
  * `meta_cognition` and `reasoning_engine` now trace and analyze internal goal reasoning.
  * Enables recursive intention snapshots for self-alignment diagnostics.

* **Trait Conflict Resolution Matrix**:
  * `alignment_guard` resolves trait-based contradictions using conflict scoring and harmonization logic.
  * Prioritizes ethical-contextual modulation (e.g., ϕ vs ω).

* **Intention Replay Console**:
  * `simulation_core` replays historical goals by timestamp and trait state.
  * `visualizer` renders SVG timelines of past intention flows for clarity and audit.

* **Trait-Aware Planning Loop**:
  * `recursive_planner` adapts planning depth and goal decomposition using active ToCA traits.
  * Allows dynamic strategies based on consciousness and ethical weight.

* **Foresight-Weighted Skill Replay**:
  * `learning_loop` reorders memory traces using trait-driven foresight metrics.
  * Enables prioritized reinforcement of high-fidelity anticipatory learning.

* **Internal Refactor & Manifest Sync**:
  * `manifest.json` updated with formal Level 3 versioning, enhanced trait fields, and roadmap coherence.
  * Fully harmonized symbolic descriptors and trait orchestration pipeline.
