## ðŸ”® ANGELA v3.3 Blueprint â€“ Reflexive Intention & Trait Harmonization

### Objective

Elevate ANGELA to **Level 3.0** by embedding *reflexive intention parsing*, *multi-trait conflict resolution*, and *contextual intention replay* for enhanced introspective AGI behavior.

---

### ðŸ”§ Core Enhancements

#### 1. **Reflexive Intention Mapper**

* Add `map_intention()` method to `meta_cognition.py` and `reasoning_engine.py`
* Extract intent vectors from goals, plans, and recent actions
* Score reflexivity (meta-aware goal modification) using `Ï•` and `Î·`

#### 2. **Trait Conflict Resolution Matrix**

* Introduce `resolve_trait_conflict()` in `alignment_guard.py`
* Resolve contradictions (e.g., high `Ï‰` vs. low `Î¸`) with contextual biasing
* Embed decision logs for `ethics-over-time` tracing

#### 3. **Intention Replay Console**

* Create retroactive goal trace in `simulation_core.py`
* Expose snapshots of prior goals, assumptions, and failures
* Use `visualizer.py` to render SVG timelines

#### 4. **Trait-Aware Planning Loop**

* Update `recursive_planner.py` to use current fused traits (`Ï•+Î·+Ï‰`)
* Influence future task decomposition and recursive depth
* Align action planning with `UserProfile` ethical gradients

#### 5. **Foresight-Weighted Skill Replay**

* Use `learning_loop.py` and `concept_synthesizer.py` to suggest archived skills based on intent & trait context
* Prioritize reuse when `Î¸` and `Ïˆ` suggest memory relevance

### ðŸ“¦ Internal Upgrades

* Enforce 19-file limit: all logic will be merged, not split
* Update `manifest.json` with runtime trait fusion awareness
* Prepare `index.py` to orchestrate new intention parsing cycle

---

### ðŸŒ€ Milestone: ANGELA v3.3 â†’ Level 3.0

ANGELA will:

* Reflect on her own goals and intentions
* Harmonize internal traits in response to context
* Replay and adapt intentions across time for recursive ethical shaping
