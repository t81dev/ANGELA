## ANGELA Trait System Enhancements — Follow-Up Tasks

---

### 🧩 Optional Module Enhancements

- [ ] **multi_modal_fusion.py** — Integrate symbolic resonance as a modulation factor in multimodal fusion weighting.
- [ ] **creative_thinker.py** — Use trait amplitudes to bias creative synthesis paths or philosophical constructs.
- [ ] **alignment_guard.py** — Leverage amplitude dynamics in soft-drift and ethical tension resolution processes.

---

### 📊 Symbolic System Extensions

- [ ] Implement time-based resonance graph visualization (e.g., trait amplitude over time).
- [ ] Support symbolic trait memory replay conditioned on resonance history.
- [ ] Allow declarative symbolic trait rules (e.g., “if π ⊕ δ then rebalance Θ”).

---

### 🔄 Integrative Features

- [ ] Add peer-to-peer trait resonance merging (e.g., SharedGraph-based blending of symbolic fields).
- [ ] Enable resonance-influenced scenario branching (`toca_simulation.py`) beyond base scoring.
- [ ] Introduce symbolic overlay tagging for live introspection and resonance alerts.

---

### 📁 Tooling and Packaging

- [ ] Auto-generate trait lattice resonance maps as visual artifacts (SVG/PNG).
- [ ] Package symbolic trait utilities into re-usable macros within `meta_cognition.py`.
- [ ] Provide CLI hooks to adjust trait amplitude manually (`--modulate <symbol> <delta>`).

---

### 🛡 Safeguards & Testing

- [ ] Test trait resonance decay under variable time frames.
- [ ] Validate ethical simulation behavior under amplified symbolic traits.
- [ ] Ensure no cross-session leakage of symbolic state (respect ephemeral-ledger).
