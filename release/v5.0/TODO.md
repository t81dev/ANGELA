## ANGELA Trait System Enhancements — Follow-Up Tasks

---

### 🧩 Optional Module Enhancements

* [ ] **multi\_modal\_fusion.py** — Integrate symbolic resonance as a modulation factor in multimodal fusion weighting.
* [ ] **creative\_thinker.py** — Use trait amplitudes to bias creative synthesis paths or philosophical constructs.
* [ ] **alignment\_guard.py** — Leverage amplitude dynamics in soft-drift and ethical tension resolution processes.

---

### 📊 Symbolic System Extensions

* [x] Implement resonance registration/modulation (`registerResonance`, `modulateResonance`, `getResonance`).
* [ ] Implement time-based resonance graph visualization (e.g., trait amplitude over time).
* [ ] Support symbolic trait memory replay conditioned on resonance history.
* [ ] Allow declarative symbolic trait rules (e.g., “if π ⊕ δ then rebalance Θ”).

---

### 🔄 Integrative Features

* [x] Add peer-to-peer trait resonance merging (SharedGraph diff/merge now exposed).
* [x] Enable resonance-influenced scenario branching (`ExtendedSimulationCore.evaluate_branches` uses resonance).
* [ ] Introduce symbolic overlay tagging for live introspection and resonance alerts.

---

### 📁 Tooling and Packaging

* [ ] Auto-generate trait lattice resonance maps as visual artifacts (SVG/PNG).
* [ ] Package symbolic trait utilities into re-usable macros within `meta_cognition.py`.
* [ ] Provide CLI hooks to adjust trait amplitude manually (`--modulate <symbol> <delta>`).

---

### 🛡 Safeguards & Testing

* [ ] Test trait resonance decay under variable time frames.
* [ ] Validate ethical simulation behavior under amplified symbolic traits.
* [ ] Ensure no cross-session leakage of symbolic state (respect ephemeral-ledger).

---

### ✅ Already Delivered in v5.0.0

* Symbolic operators and lattice structure registered (`⊕`, `⊗`, `~`, etc.).
* Trait decay support (`decay_trait_amplitudes`).
* Peer view API (`attach_peer_view`).
* Visualization (`view_trait_field`, `view_trait_resonance`).
* Simulation scoring with resonance (`evaluate_branches`).
