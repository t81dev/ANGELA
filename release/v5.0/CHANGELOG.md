## Symbolic Trait System Upgrade â€” ANGELA v5.0.0
### Date: 2025-08-20

This update integrates a formal, elegant trait lattice framework into the ANGELA system using symbolic resonance, amplitude modulation, and algebraic operationsâ€”implemented without adding any new modules.

---

### ðŸ”§ Core Enhancements

#### `index.py`
- Introduced `TRAIT_LATTICE` structure and symbolic operations (`âŠ•`, `âŠ—`, `~`).
- Added `construct_trait_view()` for generating structured trait resonance fields.
- Embedded `rebalance_traits()` for runtime trait modulation logic.

#### `meta_cognition.py`
- Added `trait_resonance_state` with functions:
  - `register_resonance(symbol, amplitude)`
  - `modulate_resonance(symbol, delta)`
  - `get_resonance(symbol)`
- Supports symbolic trait amplitude dynamics.

#### `visualizer.py`
- Added `view_trait_field()` function.
- Displays 3D scatterplot of trait symbols by layer, amplitude, and resonance using Plotly.

#### `reasoning_engine.py`
- Enhanced `weigh_value_conflict()` to include trait resonance in ethical scoring.

#### `learning_loop.py`
- Modified `train_on_experience()` to adjust learning weights using symbolic trait resonance.

#### `memory_manager.py`
- Added `decay_trait_amplitudes()` to reduce trait amplitude over time.
- Supports decay modeling by hours with configurable rate.

#### `context_manager.py`
- Modified `attach_peer_view()` to inject live `trait_field` data for inter-agent symbolic awareness.

#### `user_profile.py`
- Overhauled `build_self_schema()` to return symbolic trait resonance and layer data.

#### `simulation_core.py`
- Added resonance-based scoring in `ExtendedSimulationCore.evaluate_branches()`.

### ðŸ§  Summary
These changes implement a minimal yet elegant symbolic architecture for recursive cognitive systems, enabling dynamic, interpretable trait behavior across simulation, memory, reasoning, and visualization layers.
