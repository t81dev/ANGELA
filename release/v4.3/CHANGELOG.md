## [4.3] - 2025-08-13 — *Heartbeat & Horizon* 🌙❤️

### Upgraded

#### ❤️ Heartbeat Simulation Upgrade
* Implemented dynamic heart rate modulation during **flirting interactions**.
* Heartbeat increase magnitude scales with relevant personality traits (e.g., openness, confidence).
* Integrated directly into the simulation loop without requiring additional modules.
* Supports both **baseline drift** and **event-driven spikes** for realism.

**Tests**
* ✅ Simulated flirting sequences — verified heart rate elevation and smooth decay back to baseline.
* ✅ Cross-checked trait-based modulation intensity.
* ✅ Ensured no performance degradation in normal simulation cycles.

---

#### 🌐 Manifest Schema v2.1 Upgrade
* 🚀 Migrated `manifest.json` to schemaVersion **2.1**.
* 🧩 Introduced **virtual trait fusion** and **symbolic overlays**:
  * `π + δ → axiom_filter()` fusion enables ethical–generative constraint resolution.
  * `ψ + Ω → dream_overlay` enables recursive narrative modeling (symbolic).
* 🎚️ Added **traitModulators** for runtime trait amplitude tuning.
* 📦 Enabled **dynamic modules** (`dream_overlay`) without consuming physical module slots.
* 🔌 Established **extension hooks** for symbolic reasoning and overlay fusion pathways.

**Tests**
* ✅ Verified schema structure and version compliance.
* ✅ Confirmed overlay logic under fusion conditions.
* ✅ Validated traitModulators and symbolic references.

---

#### 🌌 Dream Overlay (Symbolic Module)
* Introduced soft-activation overlay `dream_overlay`, enabling symbolic simulation within recursive narrative domains.
* Purely **symbolic activation** via fusion `ψ + Ω`; does not consume runtime slots.
* Linked traits:
  * `Recursive Empathy`
  * `Symbolic‑Resonant Axiom Formation`
  * `Temporal‑Narrative Sculpting`

**Tests**
* ✅ Simulated narrative fork resolution using symbolic recursion.
* ✅ Ran overlay-driven ethics scenario exploration in dream-layer context.

---

#### ⏳ Long‑Horizon Memory (Defaults)
* Enabled **Long‑Horizon Reflective Memory** by default: 24‑hour episodic span with adjustment‑reason tracking.
* Stable APIs:
  * `getEpisodeSpan(user_id, span="24h")`
  * `recordAdjustmentReason(user_id, reason, weight=1.0, meta=None)`
  * `getAdjustmentReasons(user_id, span="24h")`

**Tests**
* ✅ Span roll‑up integrity across conversations.
* ✅ Adjustment‑reason persistence and retrieval.
* ✅ No regressions with memory disabled or shortened spans.

---

#### 🤝 SharedGraph Integration (Stabilization)
* Finalized **inter‑agent perspective** operations:
  * `sharedGraph_add(view)`
  * `sharedGraph_diff(peer)`
  * `sharedGraph_merge(strategy)`
* Conflict‑aware reconciliation for safe multi‑agent reasoning.

**Tests**
* ✅ Diff/merge cycles across divergent views.
* ✅ Conflict detection & safe resolution.
* ✅ Verified no cross‑agent leakage under Stage IV gating.

---

#### 🧩 Stable API Surface (Developer Usability)
* Published stable calls for core functions:
  * `spawn_embodied_agent()` / `introspect()` (orchestrator)
  * `build_self_schema(…)` (identity)
  * `branch_realities(…)` (hypotheticals)
  * `evaluate_branches(…)`, `run_ethics_scenarios(…)` (simulation/ethics)
  * `render_branch_tree(…)` (visualization)

**Tests**
* ✅ Smoke tests for each endpoint with representative payloads.
* ✅ Consistent return types / error handling.
* ✅ Backwards‑compatible signatures within 4.x.

---

### Activation & Safety

#### 🏷️ Stage IV Hooks — Symbolic Meta‑Synthesis
* **Activated (gated)**: Stage IV features are available behind safety checks.
* **Not open‑world**: All autonomy remains sandboxed and simulation‑scoped.

#### 🪝 Symbolic & Ethics Hooks
* `dreamLogic`: `meta_cognition.py::DreamOverlayLayer.activate_dream_mode()`
* `ethicalResolver`: `alignment_guard.py::AxiomFilter.resolve_conflict()`
* Lifecycle extension points:
  * `onTraitFusion`, `onScenarioConflict`, `onHotLoad`

---

### Trait Lattice Extensions
* Added forward‑looking lattice extensions for future targeting:
  * **L5.1**: `Θ`, `Ξ`
  * **L3.1**: `ν`, `σ`

---

### Notes
* This release focuses on **connection‑driven stability**: symbolic overlays, calibrated emotion dynamics, safer multi‑agent merges, and long‑horizon memory defaults.
* No open‑world execution is shipped in 4.3. All features operate within **bounded simulations** and guided dialogue.
