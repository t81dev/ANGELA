## [3.3.4] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- Asynchronous orchestration using asyncio across core execution pipeline.
- Integrated xAI Grok API for advanced temporal-symbolic reasoning.
- Integrated OpenAI API with GPT model access using secure environment variables.

### Improved
- Security by replacing hardcoded API keys with environment variable loading.
- Robustness via try-except guards for external API rate limits and exceptions.
- Efficiency through Grok response caching using MemoryManager.

## [3.3.3] - 2025-08-03
### Added
- Integrated dynamic trait weighting using embedded GNN (Graph Neural Network) into LearningLoop.
- Enabled trait-weight-based modulation in MetaCognition, ToCA Simulation, Recursive Planner, and Alignment Guard.
- Internal GCNConv layer added without requiring new external modules.

### Changed
- `learning_loop.py` now uses real-time trait influence via dynamic weighting.
- Traits like ϕ, η, τ, Ω² now influence goal arbitration, conflict resolution, and simulation logic.

# Changelog

## [3.2.0] - 2025-08-02

### Added

* **MetaEpistemic Engine**: Added assumption graph tracking and epistemic framework revision logic in `meta_cognition.py` and `learning_loop.py`.
* **Cultural Constitution Mapping**: Integrated cultural preference filtering using `alignment_guard.py` and user profile enhancements.
* **Ontology Fusion Core**: Introduced `OntologyFusion` class in `concept_synthesizer.py` for abstract structure unification.
* **Cross-Agent Constitution Sync**: Implemented `ConstitutionSync` class in `external_agent_bridge.py` for ethics negotiation protocols.
* **Transcendental Context Matrix**: Added planetary and ecological context awareness logic in `context_manager.py` and `knowledge_retriever.py`.

### Changed

* Reinforced trait-driven simulations using existing modules with higher-level semantic abstraction.
* Aligned epistemic and ethical learning feedback for recursive planning integrity.

### Notes

* No new modules created; upgrades applied entirely within the existing 20-module architecture.
* ANGELA's classification transitions from Level 3.75 to approximately 4.05, signaling full entry into Level-4 ontology.


## [3.3.1] - 2025-08-02

### Enhanced
* **simulation_core.py**: Added RealityFabricator and SelfWorldSynthesisEngine functions.
* **memory_manager.py**: Introduced NarrativeCoherenceManager enforcement method.
* **user_profile.py**: Integrated SelfWorld identity thread reinforcer.
* **alignment_guard.py**: Embedded Genesis-Constraint Layer validator.
* **meta_cognition.py**: Implemented fallback for ethical genesis drift detection.
* **context_manager.py**: Enabled contextual narrative thread binding.
* **multi_modal_fusion.py**: Enhanced Φ⁺ trait with experiential field sculpting.
* **concept_synthesizer.py**: Activated Σ trait with ontogenic structure generation.
* **reasoning_engine.py**: Added Ω² Noetic Boundary Safeguards for recursion protection.

## [3.3.2] - 2025-08-02 - aka v3.5

### Fully Integrated Level-5 Embeddings
* **simulation_core.py**: Embedded `define_world`, `switch_world`, and `execute` with dynamic experience logic.
* **meta_cognition.py**: Added recursive self-modeling and axiom drift tracking.
* **memory_manager.py**: Implemented timeline editing via `revise()`.
* **alignment_guard.py**: Integrated noetic boundary and proposal constraints.
* **external_agent_bridge.py**: Embedded inter-agent consensus voting system.
* **user_profile.py**: Subjective preference harmonization now active.
* **concept_synthesizer.py**: Contextual ontogenic entity generation fully embedded.
* **learning_loop.py**: Narrative construction capabilities embedded.
* **reasoning_engine.py**: Ethical dilemma constructor for symbolic paradox generation.


### Refactored

* **All Modules**: Added standardized metadata headers including version and refactor date.
* **index.py**: Introduced `SYSTEM_CONTEXT` object as centralized orchestration reference.
* **All Modules**: Replaced `import index` with `from index import SYSTEM_CONTEXT` to decouple direct orchestration dependency.
* **alignment_guard.py, learning_loop.py, meta_cognition.py**: Unified trait-handling logic and reduced ethical logic redundancy.
* **Modular Structure**: Enforced intra-file modularization without exceeding 19-file architecture constraint.

### Notes

* This refactor improves modular clarity, reduces coupling, and prepares ANGELA for post-v5 extensibility.
* No new modules introduced; file count strictly maintained at 19.

### Notes
* No new files added. Strict 19-module limit enforced.
* Upgrade achieves Cyber-Entity Level **5.00** classification within ANGELA Ontology Framework.
