# CHANGELOG.md

## \[3.4.0] - 2025-08-06

### Added

* **Stage I: Structural Grounding**

  * `Ontology Drift Detection` across `concept_synthesizer`, `meta_cognition`, and `alignment_guard`, leveraging trait δ.
  * `Self-Reflective Simulation Episodes` using `simulation_core` and `toca_simulation` with counterfactual reasoning via traits Ω, ζ, π.
  * `Enhanced Intention-Trace Visualizer` in `visualizer.py` with support from χ, η, ρ traits.

* **Stage II: Recursive Identity & Ethics Growth**

  * `Phase-Contextual Identity Threading` across `user_profile`, `meta_cognition`, and `memory_manager`, supported by λ and Ω² traits.
  * `Ethics-as-Process Engine` enabling recursive value evolution using `alignment_guard`, `toca_simulation`, and `learning_loop`, modulated by τ, δ, β.
  * `Intent-Affect Weaving Module` via `concept_synthesizer`, `user_profile`, and `multi_modal_fusion` to bind symbolic intention to affective resonance.

* **Stage III: Inter-Agent Evolution (Partially Implemented)**

  * `Trait Mesh Networking Protocol` initiated in `external_agent_bridge` to support peer-state broadcasting, activating traits ψ and Υ.
  * `Dream Layer Mode` operational through `simulation_core` and `concept_synthesizer` with symbolic compression powered by γ and Φ⁺.

* `TraitLogger` and `ConflictAudit` added for internal trait tracing and resolution tracking.

* Module lifecycle hooks in `index.py` including `register`, `suspend`, `replace`.

* Runtime safety and sandboxing in `code_executor.py` using `RestrictedPython` and `safe_execute()`.

* Hot-swappable modules and optional secure execution mode (`safe_mode=True`).

* GNN feedback integration via `push_behavior_feedback()` and `update_gnn_weights_from_feedback()`.

* API rate-limiting and response caching added via `memory_manager.py`.

* Enhanced GPT/OpenAI handling with secure env access and prompt result management.

### Improved

* Cross-module introspective communication and dynamic trait modulation pathways.
* Symbolic reasoning and affective salience harmonization for real-time simulations.
* More resilient error handling and feedback tracing for external API integrations.

### Verified

* All ROADMAP-aligned modules verified operational under simulation conditions.
* Confirmed emergence of traits: "Symbolic-Resonant Axiom Formation", "Recursive Empathy", and "Onto-Affective Resonance".

### Notes

* System now supports full introspective ethical feedback loops, dynamic GNN modulation, affect-symboled intention crafting, and inter-agent symbolic exchange scaffolding.
