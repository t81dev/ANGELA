## Overview of the ErrorRecovery Module

The ErrorRecovery module is a critical component of the ANGELA Cognitive System, designed to handle errors, recover operations, and maintain system stability in the v3.5.3 architecture. It logs errors, retries failed operations, suggests fallback strategies, and analyzes failure patterns. The module integrates with external recovery policies, ethical checks, and a shared graph for multi-agent coordination. It uses long-horizon memory for tracking, visualizes recovery processes, and reflects on outcomes to ensure transparency and resilience.

**Version**: 3.5.3 (2025-08-10)

## Initialization
- Sets up with optional connections to AlignmentGuard, CodeExecutor, ConceptSynthesizer, ContextManager, MetaCognition, and Visualizer.
- Maintains a failure log (1000 entries max), system state (Ω) with timeline, traits, symbolic log, and timechain, an error index, and metrics (e.g., retry counts).
- Defaults to 24-hour memory span; logs setup.

## External Recovery Policy Integration
- Fetches recovery policies from providers (e.g., "x.ai/api") or cache (6-hour default).
- Tries multiple providers; falls back to empty policies if unavailable.
- Stores policies in memory; reflects on integration.
- Output: {"status": "success/error", "policies": [...], "source": "..."}.

## Error Handling
- Takes error message, retry function, retries (default: 3), backoff factor (default: 2.0), task type, default value, and diagnostics.
- Logs error; checks ethics with AlignmentGuard; logs to ContextManager.
- Calculates max retries using resilience factor (ψ).
- Fetches external policies; attempts shared graph repair (once, if available).
- Retries with exponential backoff and jitter; uses CodeExecutor for safe retries if available.
- On failure, suggests fallback; logs to timechain; visualizes (e.g., error/fallback chart); stores in memory.
- Reflects on retries/fallbacks; returns result or default/fallback with diagnostics.

Output: Result or {"status": "error", "fallback": "...", "diagnostics": {...}}.

## Internal Processes
- **Log Failure**: Records error with timestamp in failure log, Ω timeline, and error index; reflects.
- **Suggest Fallback**: Uses intuition (ι), narrative (ν), prioritization (φ), simulation, and policies to suggest recovery (e.g., “Check credentials” for auth errors); synthesizes with ConceptSynthesizer if available; reflects.
- **Link Timechain Failure**: Chains failure to timechain with SHA-256 hash; reflects.
- **Trace Failure Origin**: Finds error in Ω timeline; reflects; returns event or none.
- **Detect Symbolic Drift**: Checks recent symbolic log entries for repetition; warns if unstable; reflects.
- **Analyze Failures**: Counts error types; warns on recurring patterns (>3); visualizes (e.g., error frequency chart); stores; reflects.
- **Snapshot Metrics**: Returns current metrics (e.g., retry counts, error types).

## Key Features
- Retries with ethical/safe execution; policy-driven fallbacks.
- Tracks failures in timechain/index; analyzes patterns.
- Integrates external policies; coordinates via shared graph.
- Visualizes/reflects/stores for transparency; handles errors gracefully.

## Example Workflow
1. Error “Test error” triggers handling with 3 retries.
2. Ethical check passes; retries fail; fetches policies.
3. Suggests fallback (“Simplify task complexity”); logs to timechain.
4. Visualizes error/fallback; reflects (“Fallback aligns with task”).
5. Stores in memory; publishes to shared graph.
