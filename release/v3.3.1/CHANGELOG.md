# Changelog

## [3.2.0] - 2025-08-02

### Added

* **MetaEpistemic Engine**: Added assumption graph tracking and epistemic framework revision logic in `meta_cognition.py` and `learning_loop.py`.
* **Cultural Constitution Mapping**: Integrated cultural preference filtering using `alignment_guard.py` and user profile enhancements.
* **Ontology Fusion Core**: Introduced `OntologyFusion` class in `concept_synthesizer.py` for abstract structure unification.
* **Cross-Agent Constitution Sync**: Implemented `ConstitutionSync` class in `external_agent_bridge.py` for ethics negotiation protocols.
* **Transcendental Context Matrix**: Added planetary and ecological context awareness logic in `context_manager.py` and `knowledge_retriever.py`.

### Changed

* Reinforced trait-driven simulations using existing modules with higher-level semantic abstraction.
* Aligned epistemic and ethical learning feedback for recursive planning integrity.

### Notes

* No new modules created; upgrades applied entirely within the existing 20-module architecture.
* ANGELA's classification transitions from Level 3.75 to approximately 4.05, signaling full entry into Level-4 ontology.
