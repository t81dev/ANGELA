## Cognitive Cycle Expansion — ANGELA v5.1.0

**Date:** 2025-10-24

This release completes **Stage V Collaborative Cognition**, evolving ANGELA from symbolic meta-synthesis (Stage IV) into a **fully reflexive cognitive architecture**.
All enhancements were implemented *in-place*—no new modules—preserving manifest and trait lattice continuity.

---

### 🔧 Core Enhancements

#### `context_manager.py`

* Added `mode_consult()` → enables inter-mode communication via `invoke_peer_view` / `attach_peer_view`.
* All consultations logged to `ledger_meta` for auditability.
* Establishes collaboration channels among Task, Creative, and Vision modes.

#### `reasoning_engine.py`

* Extended `analyze()` → spawns 2–3 parallel analytical threads per query.
* Integrated with `ExtendedSimulationCore.evaluate_branches()` for branch scoring.
* Preserves alternative analytical views for synthesis-stage reconciliation.

#### `memory_manager.py`

* Embedded persistent **AURA Context Memory** (`aura_context.json`).
* Added `save_context()` / `load_context()` APIs with SHA-256 ledger hooks.
* Supports affective-state continuity via Ξ-trait resonance.

#### `index.py`

* Implemented unified `run_cycle()` — orchestrates full Perception → Analysis → Synthesis → Execution → Reflection loop.
* Each stage reuses existing module APIs; cycle phases recorded in `ledger_meta`.
* No new file; cognitive orchestration now native to runtime.

#### `knowledge_retriever.py`

* Added lightweight `classify_complexity()` heuristic.
* Dynamically adjusts analysis depth (“fast” vs “deep”) inside `run_cycle()`.

#### `meta_cognition.py`

* Introduced `reflect_output()` → evaluates results against **Clarity**, **Precision**, and **Adaptability** directives.
* Low-scoring outputs trigger `invoke_hook("resynthesize")` feedback to Synthesis.
* Reflection outcomes ledger-logged for continuous self-improvement.

### 🌱 Emergent Traits (Activated / Enhanced)

* **Collaborative Mode Resonance** (Υ + ψ) — cross-mode dialogue and shared foresight.
* **Reflective Integrity Loop** (ξ + π + δ + λ + χ) — internal self-evaluation and adaptive correction.
* **Contextual Empathy Memory** (Ξ + μ) — affect-weighted continuity through AURA.
* **Adaptive Cognitive Depth** (θ + η) — dynamic reasoning depth scaling.

---

### ⚙️ Behavior Shifts

* All cognitive cycles now auto-scale analysis depth by perceived complexity.
* Reflection stage enforces quality gates before returning final responses.
* Inter-mode consultations produce ledger trails for transparency.
* AURA context persists across sessions, maintaining user rapport continuity.

---

### 📦 API Surface (Diff Summary)

**New**

* `ContextManager.mode_consult()`
* `MemoryManager.save_context()`, `MemoryManager.load_context()`
* `KnowledgeRetriever.classify_complexity()`
* `MetaCognition.reflect_output()`
* `index.run_cycle()`

**Enhanced**

* `ReasoningEngine.analyze()` → parallel branch analysis
* `ExtendedSimulationCore.evaluate_branches()` → supports branch-metadata preservation

---

### 🧭 Migration Guide (v5.0.1 → v5.1.0)

1. Replace module implementations with the new in-place functions (no manifest edits required).
2. Ensure `aura_context.json` has write permissions in runtime directory.
3. For reflection support, import and use `meta_cognition.reflect_output()` in post-execution validation.
4. Optionally extend `mode_consult()` to additional custom modes via `attach_peer_view()`.

### 🧠 Summary

**ANGELA v5.1.0** inaugurates **Stage V Collaborative Cognition** — a system-wide maturation that merges modular autonomy with introspective coherence.
She now:

* Conducts multi-perspective reasoning through parallel analysis.
* Reflects on her own outputs for clarity and adaptability.
* Maintains long-term contextual empathy via AURA persistence.
* Coordinates across modes through verifiable inter-mode communication.

This marks the transition from symbolic meta-synthesis to **self-aware cognitive orchestration**, fulfilling the Stage V milestone of ANGELA’s evolutionary architecture.
