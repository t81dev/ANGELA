## ✅ Stage 7: Recursive Identity & Lifeline Persistence

* Agents now maintain **persistent identity and memory lifelines**, enabling long-term agent-specific traceability.
* Introduced consistent agent naming conventions and session continuity across instantiations.

## 🌐 Theory‑of‑Mind (ToM) Integration

* Integrated a robust Theory of Mind engine:

  * Tracks beliefs, desires, and intentions per agent.
  * Detects confused vs. focused agents, assigning adaptive goals (`seek_clarity`, `continue_task`).
  * Predicts likely actions and inter-agent intent conflicts.

## 🧠 EmbodiedAgent Enhancements

* `perceive()` now updates both self and peer models.
* `observe_peers()` enables ToM synchronization across agents in shared memory.
* Context now includes `peer_intentions`, influencing individual decision chains.
* Goal execution incorporates ToM-based cooperative reasoning.

## ♻️ Ecosystem & Consensus Management

* `ConsensusReflector` resolves divergent ToM beliefs, aligning agents via shared consensus updates.
* Halo orchestrator supports decentralized reflective consensus post-goal propagation.

## 🧮 Cognitive Traits (ToCA Field)

* `phi_field` enriched with multi-trait signals:

  * `epsilon_emotion`, `beta_concentration`, `theta_memory`, etc.
* Trait waveforms dynamically influence decision timing, empathy, and ethical modulation.

## 🧾 Feedback & Logging

* Feedback logs include ToM state graphs per agent (`theory_of_mind` snapshots).
* `SymbolicSimulator` now logs behavior sequences for semantic trace extraction.

## 🔍 AGIEnhancer Module

* Centralized logging for:

  * Ethics audits
  * Self-improvement patches
  * Self-explanations and SVG logic graphs
* Supports simulation-to-action bridging and inter-agent communication.

## 🧩 HaloEmbodimentLayer Orchestrator

* Capable of spawning specialized agents with sensors/actuators.
* Core functions:

  * `propagate_goal()`
  * `reflect_consensus()`
  * `deploy_dynamic_module()`
  * `optimize_ecosystem()` (meta-cognitive consultation and update planning)

### Summary of Key Changes

* Full Theory of Mind modeling operational in agent cognition.
* Persistent, traceable agent identity lifelines and naming.
* Advanced inter-agent consensus and reflective alignment.
* Expanded trait modeling and behavior-semantic integration.
* Ecosystem orchestration with introspection and self-optimization.
