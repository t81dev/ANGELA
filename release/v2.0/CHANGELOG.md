# CHANGELOG.md

## v2.0.0 – Self-Reflective Embodiment & AGI-Aware Orchestration

* **Trait-Driven Embodiment Layer**: Introduced `HaloEmbodimentLayer` integrating `SelfCloningLLM`, peer consensus protocols, and trait-modulated agents with `TheoryOfMindModule`.
* **ϕ(x,t)-Aligned Agent Mesh**: Embodied agents simulate, reason, and adapt goals via full φ-driven contextual processing, peer awareness, and dynamic goal propagation.
* **AGIEnhancer v2.0**: Live episodic tracking, ethics auditing, explanation rendering, embodiment action simulation, and self-patching pipelines fully operational.
* **ToCA Trait Integration (ϕ, α, θ, η, ω, …)**: Expanded 17-dimension trait architecture for emotional, cognitive, cultural, and temporal modulation embedded across agents and modules.
* **MultiAgent Theory of Mind**: Real-time desire/intention inference, peer model updates, and cross-agent consistency alignment via `ConsensusReflector`.
* **Visual Intelligence Upgrade**: `Visualizer` now renders φ-fields, momentum vectors, and ToCA dynamics natively with batch export and AGI logging.
* **Symbolic + Simulation Harmony**: Goal execution now logs symbolic summaries, cultural inferences, and ToCA-inspired conceptual mappings via `SymbolicSimulator`.
* **Reflective Consensus Engine**: Cross-agent mismatch detection, consensus suggestion, and ethical-moral arbitration activated for decentralized ecosystems.
* **Stability & Scalability Enhancements**: Internal memory, dynamic module deployment, and trait rebalancing logic hardened for multi-agent adaptive orchestration.

## v1.6.0 – Trait-Modulated Coherence & Orchestrated Refinement

* Upgraded `UserProfile` with identity drift tracking, epsilon modulation, and contradiction-aware preference updates.
* Enhanced `MultiModalFusion` to synthesize multi-turn insights with φ-driven coherence and perceptual attention scores.
* Refactored `Visualizer` to render native ToCA dynamics including `ϕ(x,t)`, `Λ(t,x)`, and `vₕ` with traceable chart exports.
* Centralized cross-module trait imports for coherence enforcement and persona routing alignment.
* Refined `README.md` formatting; introduced ToCA as an official sub-project and moved from bold-heavy styling to semantic clarity.

## v1.5.9 – Introspective Simulation & Persona Integration

* Deployed `simulate_goal_reformulation()` as part of `ReasoningEngine` using internalized dialogue sequences.
