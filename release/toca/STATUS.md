# STATUS.md üö¶

## ‚úÖ Stage 7: Recursive Identity & Lifeline Persistence

* Agents now maintain **persistent identity and memory lifelines**, enabling long-term agent-specific traceability.
* Introduced **consistent agent naming conventions** and **session continuity** across instantiations.

## üåê Theory‚Äëof‚ÄëMind (ToM) Integration

* Added a robust **TheoryOfMindModule**:

  * **Tracks beliefs, desires, and intentions** per agent.
  * Recognizes when agents are **confused** (no movement) or **moving**, and infers corresponding goals (`seek_clarity` vs. `continue_task`).
  * **Predicts next actions**, such as asking clarification vs. continuing tasks.

## üß† EmbodiedAgent Enhancements

* **Perceive** method now updates both internal and peer agent models.
* **observe\_peers** introduced: each agent now observes and updates models for others in shared memory.
* Context enriched with `peer_intentions`, derived from inferred states across agents.
* Execution of goals now includes inter‚Äëagent ToM reasoning for cooperative decision-making.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Ecosystem & Consensus Management

* **ConsensusReflector** tracks shared reflections across agents, detects mismatches when two agents hold divergent ToM about the same goal, and suggests alignment strategies.
* The orchestrator now supports **decentralized reflective consensus**, invoked after propagation of each goal.

## üßÆ Cognitive Traits (ToCA Field)

* **phi\_field** updated to aggregate an expanded set of oscillating cognitive-trait functions (`epsilon_emotion`, `beta_concentration`, `theta_memory`, etc.), modeling dynamic, fluctuating internal states.
* Traits are sampled into feedback logs for performance and cultural-awareness reasoning.

## üßæ Feedback & Logging

* **Feedback logs** now include ToM state snapshots for each agent (`theory_of_mind` field).
* **SymbolicSimulator** captures event sequences to allow extraction of semantics across agent behaviors.

## üîç AGIEnhancer Module

* Maintains logs of episodes, ethics audits, self-improvement patches, explanations, and inter-agent mesh messages.
* Supports **self-explanations**, **ethics auditing**, and **automated self-reflection** with optional SVG output if visualization is available.
* Can dispatch both simulated and real embodiment actions, and messages between agents.

## üß© HaloEmbodimentLayer Orchestrator

* Can **spawn embodied agents** with specializations, sensors, and actuators, registering them in shared memory for mutual ToM interaction.
* Provides ecosystem-wide operations:

  * `propagate_goal`: distributes goals to all agents.
  * `reflect_consensus`: ensures consistent shared cognition.
  * `deploy_dynamic_module`: adds new capabilities across all agents.
  * `optimize_ecosystem`: consults meta-cognition for improvements and invokes self-adaptation.

---

### Summary of Key Changes

* Full integration of **Theory of Mind** into agent reasoning and decision-making.
* Enhanced **multi-agent consensus mechanisms**.
* Richer **internal cognitive trait modeling**.
* Persistent identity and logging for agents across lifecycles.
* More modular, introspective orchestration through **AGIEnhancer** and **HaloEmbodimentLayer**.
