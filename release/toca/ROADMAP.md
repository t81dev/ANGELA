# ANGELA Project Roadmap

## Vision

Establish ANGELA as a modular cognitive architecture capable of dynamic task routing, introspective reasoning, and ethical reflection within a stateless LLM framework.

## Milestones

### Q3 2025

* [x] Stage 1: Embodied Agents with ToM integration
* [x] Stage 2: Consensus Reflector and Symbolic Simulator
* [x] Stage 3: AGIEnhancer orchestration and self-improvement
* [x] Stage 4: Cultural semantic feedback loop
* [x] Stage 5: Lifeline persistence and recursive memory
* [x] Stage 6: Decentralized reflective consensus engine
* [x] Stage 7: Recursive Identity and Lifeline Persistence

### Q4 2025

* [ ] Full Decentralized Consensus across multi-agent environments
* [ ] Expanded Theory of Mind using emergent simulation scenarios
* [ ] Modular AGI Enhancer extension pack (plugins: ethics+++, empathy, resource planner)
* [ ] Real-world sensor integration simulation

### 2026

* [ ] External Actor Bridge with Webhooks
* [ ] E2E self-debugging and continuous learning loop validation
* [ ] Expand on real-time symbolic-semantic consensus interpretation
* [ ] Publish whitepaper on ANGELA cognitive layering

## Long-term Goals

* Scale to distributed AGI mesh architecture
* Enable persistent self-aware agent chains (timechain replacement)
* Formalize and validate artificial phenomenology framework
