# CHANGELOG.md

## v1.5.7 – Recursive Identity & Lifeline Persistence

* Added advanced theory of mind modeling with inter-agent inference.
* Implemented feedback logging with ToCA-inspired phi\_field traits.
* Introduced decentralized reflective consensus via `ConsensusReflector`.
* Symbolic simulator logs cultural and semantic data per agent action.
* AGIEnhancer now handles episodic logs, ethics audits, mesh messages, and embodiment tracking.
* Integrated `HaloEmbodimentLayer` with dynamic agent spawning, optimization, and consensus syncing.

## v1.5.6 – Reflective Feedback Loop Integration

* Feedback loop added with `MetaCognition.review_reasoning()`.
* Contextual self-scoring integrated using `run_self_diagnostics()`.
* Trait computation introduced with sinusoidal traits (e.g., emotion, memory).

## v1.5.5 – Enhanced Embodiment & Simulation

* Added symbolic and visual simulations through `SymbolicSimulator`.
* Peer intention modeling added via shared memory loop.
* Agents now build peer models for better Theory of Mind capabilities.

## v1.5.4 – Modular Infrastructure Upgrade

* Dynamic module deployment introduced.
* Improved module imports using `from modules import ...` standard.
* Agent performance logs and task completion tracking enabled.

## v1.5.3 – Planning and Reasoning Expansion

* `RecursivePlanner` integrated with multi-layer goal decomposition.
* Reasoning engine supports contextual trace synthesis.
* Concept synthesis reworked to support goal-task integration.

## v1.5.2 – Safety and Ethics Update

* Added ethics audits through `AlignmentGuard.audit()`.
* Reflect-and-adapt method added for real-time self-improvement.

## v1.5.1 – Bootstrapping and Initialization

* Established module registry and dynamic module slots.
* Initialized `HaloEmbodimentLayer`, including shared memory store.

## v1.5.0 – ANGELA Initialization

* Core modules instantiated: reasoning, planning, meta-cognition, simulation.
* Created manifest and index orchestrator.
* Halo runtime launched for modular cognitive loop.
