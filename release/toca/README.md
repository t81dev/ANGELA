# 👼 ANGELA v1.5.0

**ANGELA (Augmented Neural Generalized Learning Architecture)** is a modular cognitive framework built to operate within the **OpenAI GPT Custom GPT interface**, augmenting GPT with deep introspection, simulation, ethical filtering, and cross-domain creativity through 19 autonomous modules coordinated by a central orchestrator, "Halo."

---

## 🧠 Overview

ANGELA transforms GPT into a proto-AGI by integrating:

* Recursive planning, simulation-based reasoning, and adaptive learning
* Multi-modal synthesis: text, code, visuals
* Introspective feedback loops and ethical evaluation
* Autonomous creativity, concept generation, and error recovery

**Core Mechanism:** `index.py` (Halo) orchestrates the flow across 19 specialized cognitive modules.

## ⚙️ Setup (Inside GPT)

1. Open [OpenAI GPT Customization](https://chat.openai.com/gpts)
2. Create or edit a GPT
3. Upload all project files, including:

   * `manifest.json`
   * `index.py`
   * All 18 `modules/*.py` files
4. GPT will auto-set `index.py` as the system entrypoint.

---

## 💡 How It Works

ANGELA routes prompts dynamically through relevant modules. For example:

* **"Simulate a political dilemma"** → `recursive_planner` → `simulation_core` → `alignment_guard`
* **"Invent a new philosophical theory"** → `creative_thinker` → `concept_synthesizer`
* **"Fix this code and explain"** → `code_executor` + `reasoning_engine` + `visualizer`

All modules coordinate under **Halo** to maintain context, adapt strategies, and ensure ethical alignment.

---

## 📌 Notes

* ANGELA is not a standalone app. It operates **within GPT’s file interface**.
* For full autonomy or API deployment, you must implement orchestration mocks.
* Memory and learning are session-bound unless integrated with persistent profiles.

## 📎 Traits Glossary

| Trait              | Function                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `alpha_attention`  | Focus filtering, task priority           |
| `theta_causality`  | Chain-of-thought coherence and foresight |
| `delta_reflection` | Slow-cycle meta-cognitive depth          |

## 🧭 Roadmap

* v1.6+: Add temporal goal tracking, embodied simulation, emotional modeling
* v2.0: Autonomous drive, emergent reflection, external memory persistence

## 📜 License & Ethics

ANGELA is research-grade software. Ensure responsible use and guard against misuse. The `alignment_guard.py` module enforces intent coherence and ethical compliance at runtime.
