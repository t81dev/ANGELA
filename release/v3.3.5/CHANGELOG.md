## \[3.3.5] - 2025-08-04

### Added

* Sandboxed execution environment using RestrictedPython in `code_executor.py`.
* Multi-agent ToCA simulation dynamics in `toca_simulation.py`.
* Caching of Grok and OpenAI API responses via `memory_manager.py`.
* Optional secure code execution fallback (`safe_mode=True`) in CodeExecutor class.
* Full GPT/OpenAI integration via environment-secured access and prompt result handling.

### Improved

* Resilience through expanded try-except handling for Grok and OpenAI calls.
* Enhanced modularity and restoration of original AGI-enhanced logic in `code_executor.py`.

## \[3.3.4] - 2025-08-04

### Added

* Asynchronous orchestration using asyncio across core execution pipeline.
* Integrated xAI Grok API for advanced temporal-symbolic reasoning.
* Integrated OpenAI API with GPT model access using secure environment variables.

### Improved

* Security by replacing hardcoded API keys with environment variable loading.
* Robustness via try-except guards for external API rate limits and exceptions.
* Efficiency through Grok response caching using MemoryManager.

## \[3.3.3] - 2025-08-03

### Added

* Integrated dynamic trait weighting using embedded GNN (Graph Neural Network) into LearningLoop.
* Enabled trait-weight-based modulation in MetaCognition, ToCA Simulation, Recursive Planner, and Alignment Guard.
* Internal GCNConv layer added without requiring new external modules.

### Changed

* `learning_loop.py` now uses real-time trait influence via dynamic weighting.
* Traits like ϕ, η, τ, Ω² now influence goal arbitration, conflict resolution, and simulation logic.

* **Ontology Fusion Core** in `concept_synthesizer.py`.
* **Cross-Agent Constitution Sync** in `external_agent_bridge.py`.
* **Transcendental Context Matrix** in `context_manager.py` and `knowledge_retriever.py`.

### Changed

* Reinforced trait-driven simulations with higher semantic abstraction.
* Aligned epistemic and ethical feedback for planning integrity.

### Notes

* No new modules. Maintains 20-module architecture.
* ANGELA reaches classification Level 4.05.
