Here’s your **updated `TODO.md`**, reflecting the fact that all Stage V features are now **implemented in-place** within existing modules — no new files added.
I’ve converted completed tasks to `[x]`, clarified “embedded” integration notes, and adjusted the summary to mark the transition from planning → execution.

# TODO.md — ANGELA Stage V Upgrades ✅ *(Implemented In-Place)*

## 1. Enhance Modularity with Inter-Mode Communication

* [x] Implemented `mode_consult()` protocol in `context_manager.py`
* [x] Enabled Task Mode ↔ Creative Mode consultation via `invoke_peer_view` / `attach_peer_view`
* [x] Added Vision Mode consultation hook for long-term implications
* [x] Logged all consultations in `ledger_meta` for auditability

**Benefit:**
Breaks silo walls; modes now collaborate while preserving modular purity.

---

## 2. Add Depth to Analysis + Synthesis

* [x] Extended `reasoning_engine` to generate 2–3 parallel analysis threads per query
* [x] Reused `ExtendedSimulationCore.evaluate_branches()` to preserve alternative views
* [x] Enhanced Synthesis stage integration via `CreativeThinker.bias_synthesis()` conflict resolution

**Benefit:**
Introduces true multi-perspective reasoning and branch-aware synthesis.

---

## 3. Strengthen AURA with Contextual Memory Layer

* [x] Embedded persistent AURA memory store (`aura_context.json`) in `memory_manager.py`
* [x] Added `save_context(user_id, summary, affective_state)` and `load_context(user_id)`
* [x] Ledger-logged AURA updates and affective patterns via `meta_cognition`
* [x] Integrated affective resonance hook (Ξ-trait) for emotional continuity

**Benefit:**
Enables rapport continuity and long-term empathy modeling.

---

## 4. Formalize the Cognitive Cycle in Codebase

* [x] Embedded Cognitive Cycle orchestration (`run_cycle()`) directly in `index.py`
* [x] Linked existing modules — retriever → reasoner → creator → executor → meta-reflector
* [x] Logged cycle phases and durations to `ledger_meta` for traceability
* [x] Cycle now operational under Stage V identity without adding new modules

**Benefit:**
Makes ANGELA’s conceptual identity explicit and operational in runtime flow.

---

## 5. Introduce Dynamic Weighting to the Cognitive Cycle

* [x] Added complexity classifier in `knowledge_retriever.py` (token + semantic heuristics)
* [x] Dynamically adjusts analysis depth (fast vs deep paths) in `run_cycle()`
* [x] Logged resource allocation and classification events in `ledger_meta`

**Benefit:**
Adaptive processing — efficiency for simple queries, depth for complex ones.

---

## 6. Evolve Feedback Loop → Reflection Stage

* [x] Implemented `reflect_output()` in `meta_cognition.py`
* [x] Added heuristic evaluation of Clarity, Precision, and Adaptability
* [x] Auto-loops low-score outputs back to Synthesis via `invoke_hook("resynthesize")`
* [x] Recorded reflection scores and feedback in `ledger_meta`

**Benefit:**
Adds final quality-assurance reflection — improving reliability and trust.

# ✅ Stage V Summary

* Deepened ANGELA’s Cognitive Cycle without adding new modules.
* Enabled inter-mode collaboration through `mode_consult`.
* Strengthened AURA as a contextual memory and affective continuity layer.
* Introduced dynamic processing depth and reflexive feedback into runtime flow.

Stage V is an **evolutionary upgrade** — authentic growth within ANGELA’s symbolic kernel, seamlessly integrated with Stage IV’s meta-synthesis architecture.

Would you like me to append a **“Stage V Release Notes”** block at the bottom (like those in your manifest changelog), summarizing these upgrades in manifest-style JSON format for `manifest.json` version `5.1.0`?
