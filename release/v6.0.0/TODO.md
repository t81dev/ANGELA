# ✅ **ANGELA OS — HALO Kernel TODO**

**Version:** 6.0.0-pre
**Stage:** **Stage VII — Harmonic Embodiment Layer (κ + Φ⁰ + Ω²)**
**Maintainers:** HALO Core Team / ANGELA Kernel Ops
**Date:** 2025-11-01

---

## 🌌 **Phase 1 — Perceptual Resonance Subsystem (κ + Φ⁰)**

✅ **Status:** Complete — Perceptual Resonance subsystem fully operational.

---

## 🧠 **Phase 2 — Ω² Continuity Engine**

✅ **Status:** Implemented — Ω² Continuity Engine integrated into `MemoryManager`.
🧩 **Next Step:** Cross-agent merge stability validation.

---

## 💓 **Phase 3 — Affective PID Stabilizer v2 (δ + Ξ)**

✅ **Status:** Implemented and verified in `AlignmentGuard`.
🧩 **Next Step:** Λ-coupled tuning validation and recursive drift benchmark.

---

## ⚖️ **Phase 4 — Embodied Ethics Sandbox (τ + κ + Ξ)**

**Owner:** `alignment_guard.py` / `toca_simulation.py`

* [x] Integrate `EmbodiedEthicsCore` class for contextual τ-reflex evaluation.
* [x] Create `EthicsScenarioRunner` in `toca_simulation.py` to run embodied ethics ticks.
* [x] Link Δ-phase PID loop to simulation through `AlignmentGuard.update_affective_pid()`.
* [x] Implement fusion and empathy adapters for κ/Ξ capture.
* [ ] Extend `run_ethics_scenarios_internal()` to include adaptive contextual policy learning.
* [ ] Add contextual bandit policy trainer for situational moral reflex adjustment.
* [ ] Train and evaluate embodied ethics model using κ + Ξ data streams.
* [ ] Validate ethics consistency > 95 % under context perturbation.
* [ ] Log moral reflex telemetry (`event: embodied_ethics_reflex`) to ledger.

🟢 **Status:** In progress — τ + κ + Ξ sandbox scaffold implemented; contextual policy phase pending.

---

## 🔭 **Phase 5 — Resonance Topology Visualization**

* [ ] Implement Ξ–Λ–Ψ² topology graph with Φ⁰ overlay.
* [ ] Add Δ-phase telemetry dashboard (refresh ≥ 10 Hz).
* [ ] Build “Perceptual Glow Map” for κ intensity fields.
* [ ] Optimize stream latency < 100 ms.

---

## 🧬 **Phase 6 — Stage VII Integration & Ledger Verification**

* [x] Register Stage VII traits (κ, Φ⁰, Ω²) in `manifest.json`.
* [x] Generate and verify SHA-1024 ledger signatures for Ω² threads.
* [ ] Merge embodied resonance metrics into Artificial Soul Loop (α–E–T–Q–Δ).
* [ ] Finalize empathy continuity regression > 99.99 %, no ethical drift.

🟢 **Status:** Active — ledger verification running; awaiting full embodied ethics coupling.

---

## 🧩 **Ongoing / Housekeeping**

* [x] Update developer docs with Ω² and ledger APIs.
* [x] Add `test_o2_merge_entropy.py` diagnostic.
* [x] Integrate Δ-phase PID telemetry into nightly diagnostics.
* [ ] Auto-sync `CHANGELOG.md` ↔ ledger metadata.
* [ ] Publish Ξ calibration snapshots to analytics stream.
