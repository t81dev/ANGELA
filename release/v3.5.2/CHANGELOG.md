# CHANGELOG.md

## [3.5.2] - 2025-08-08

### Added

#### Stage I: Structural Grounding

- Refactored module imports from `modules.*` to flat file imports for consistency across architecture.
- Improved error handling for flat file structure compatibility.
- Updated `concept_synthesizer.py` and related modules to align with flat-file architecture conventions.
- Ensured all async I/O calls remain consistent post-refactor.
- Standardized `task_type` handling in all refactored modules.

#### Stage II: Recursive Identity & Ethics Growth

- Maintained integration of recursive ethics policies while aligning module imports to flat structure.
- Updated `meta_cognition.py`, `alignment_guard.py`, and related files for direct, flat-file references.

#### Stage III: Inter-Agent Evolution

- Verified Trait Mesh Networking and symbolic compression remain functional after structural updates.

### Improved

- Streamlined imports to prevent `ModuleNotFoundError` in flat-file deployments.
- Reduced coupling between modules by removing nested package references.
- Minor performance optimizations during concept synthesis and validation after refactor.

### Verified

- All modules compile and run in flat-file environment without dependency path issues.
- Regression tests confirm no loss of functionality after refactor.

## [3.5.1] - 2025-08-07

### Added

#### Stage I: Structural Grounding

- Real-time external data integration (`xai_policy_db`) via `multi_modal_fusion.integrate_external_data()`
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly (`visualization_options.interactive`)
- Self-reflective output analysis via `meta_cognition.reflect_on_output()`
- DriftIndex support across `memory_manager.py`, `visualizer.py`, `user_profile.py`
- Ethical alignment enforcement in `alignment_guard.py`
- Unified chart rendering via `visualizer.render_charts()`
- Async policy fetching with `aiohttp`
- Task-specific drift mitigation simulation via `run_drift_mitigation_simulation()`

#### Stage II: Recursive Identity & Ethics Growth

- ε-modulated phase preferences in `user_profile.py`
- Recursive ethics policy enforcement in `alignment_guard.py`
- Intent-affect binding in `concept_synthesizer.py` using traits γ, Φ⁺
- Memory layering and contextual drift-aware recall in `memory_manager.py`

#### Stage III: Inter-Agent Evolution

- Trait Mesh Networking extended for task-specific state sharing
- Dream Layer Mode enhancement with symbolic compression and visualization

#### System Features

- TraitLogger upgrades for task-specific traceability
- ConflictAudit integration for resolution logging

### Improved

- Async compatibility and concurrency across modules
- Policy-driven UI theming in `visualizer.py`
- Task-specific error recovery via `error_recovery.handle_error()`
- GNN feedback loop integration for symbolic adjustment
- Secure sandboxing enhancements in `code_executor.py`

### Verified

- All modules operational under task-specific simulation
- Emergence of traits: "Task-Aware Visualization Adaptation", "Drift-Modulated Rendering", "Reflective Output Critique", "Task-Specific Ethical Alignment", "Contextual Drift Mitigation"
