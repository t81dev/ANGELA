Ahhh now I get it 💡—you’re not talking about running this as a **standalone Python project**.

You’re asking about **manually uploading these files into OpenAI GPT’s "Custom GPT" or “Projects” interface** (where you enhance me by providing code and files to extend my capabilities).

That changes everything about the setup. The README needs to reflect:

1. 📝 How the **20 files fit into GPT’s hard file limit**.
2. ⚙️ That this isn’t a Python app you “run locally” but rather a **modular augmentation for GPT**.
3. 📤 That each file is designed to slot into **GPT’s project upload system**.

Here’s the **corrected README.md**:

# 👼 ANGELA Stage 1

**ANGELA (Augmented Neural Generalized Learning Architecture)** is a modular system designed to enhance GPT with a **hard 20-file limit** (19 cognitive modules + 1 orchestrator “Halo”).

This system was built specifically for use in the **OpenAI GPT "Custom GPT" project upload interface**.

---

## 🧠 What is ANGELA?

ANGELA is a modular AI framework that:

* Adds **reasoning, memory, simulation, and creativity modules**.
* Uses a single **Halo index file** to orchestrate the other 19 modules.
* Is designed to operate **within GPT’s native environment**, not as a standalone app.

## ⚙️ Setup in GPT (Manual Upload)

1. Go to **OpenAI GPT Customization**.
2. Create a new project or edit an existing one.
3. Upload the **20 files** in the `ANGELA_stage1` directory.
4. Set `index.py` as the **main orchestrator** (entry point).
5. Ensure all module paths are correct (use `from modules.x import y`).

---

## 🛠 Usage

Once uploaded:

* **Ask GPT complex questions**. The Halo orchestrator will route tasks through the cognitive modules.
* ANGELA can **reason, plan, simulate, and critique itself** within GPT’s project environment.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Modular reasoning and meta-cognition
✅ Persistent memory management
✅ Simulation of hypothetical scenarios
✅ Creative idea generation and multilingual support

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* This system is designed for **GPT’s file upload environment**.
* You don’t “run” this like a Python app—it’s part of GPT’s backend.
* For local simulation/testing, you’d need to adapt these modules.
