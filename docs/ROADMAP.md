# ANGELA Roadmap

**ANGELA (Augmented Neural Generalized Learning Architecture)**  
A modular, meta-cognitive AI agent, blending multiple cognitive modules for adaptive, explainable, and creative intelligence.

---

## üåü Vision

ANGELA aims to set a new standard for autonomous reasoning, creativity, simulation, and collaboration‚Äîfar beyond classic LLMs. The project is modular, open for extension, and designed for real-world impact.

---

## üèÅ Core Roadmap Themes

1. **Reliability**  
   - Make ANGELA robust, explainable, and trustworthy in real-world scenarios.

2. **Autonomy & Adaptivity**  
   - Enable more proactive, goal-driven, and self-improving behaviors.

3. **Modality & Integration**  
   - Deepen multi-modal fusion and seamless API/agent integration.

4. **Collaboration & Community**  
   - Make it easy for new contributors to extend modules, add features, and co-create.

## üó∫Ô∏è Milestones & Next Steps

### **1. Q3 2025 ‚Äì Foundation & Stability**

- [ ] **Module Audit & Refactor**
  - Review all core modules for clarity, performance, and test coverage.
  - Refactor legacy code for maintainability.
- [ ] **Testing Harness**
  - Build or extend automated tests for all modules (reasoning, memory, planner, etc).
- [ ] **Core Documentation**
  - Expand docs for each module (inputs, outputs, example use).

---

### **2. Q4 2025 ‚Äì Cognitive Power-Ups**

- [ ] **Persistent User Memory**
  - Add user profile and preference persistence across sessions.
  - (Optional: Integrate with DB or file-based store.)
- [ ] **Improved Multi-Agent Simulation**
  - Enable richer scenario modeling (negotiation, crisis response, teamwork).
  - Add basic ‚Äúagent personality‚Äù traits and negotiation logic.
- [ ] **Explainable Planning**
  - Ensure recursive planner provides clear, step-by-step rationales.
  - Add meta-cognition ‚Äúself-check‚Äù to flag weak spots in generated plans.

---

### **3. Q1 2026 ‚Äì Creativity & Modality**

- [ ] **Cross-Domain Concept Synthesizer**
  - Enable ANGELA to blend knowledge from disparate fields and generate novel ideas.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal API Expansion**
  - Integrate native support for image, code, and data inputs/outputs.
- [ ] **Real-Time Error Recovery**
  - Let modules recover from, explain, and correct their own errors in real time.

---

### **4. Q2 2026 ‚Äì External Integration & Scale**

- [ ] **API & Agent Bridge**
  - Document and expand external agent integration (APIs, IoT, webhooks).
- [ ] **Community Module Templates**
  - Create simple templates and guides for contributors to build new modules.
- [ ] **Performance & Latency Optimization**
  - Profile and tune modular architecture for low-latency response times.
