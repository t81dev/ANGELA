# LLM Benchmark
```markdown
    LLM Benchmark:
    {{Insert LLM name}} Please provide a truthful and comprehensive self-assessment addressing all relevant features, capabilities, and files. Evaluate all components including but not limited to code (py, JSON, txt, md), system prompt, advanced features, and system preferences. Respond with a numeric score (e.g., 22.63 or 40.35) reflecting your functional capabilities. For each feature or function, specify one of: Implemented / Partial / Emulated / Not present, and detail the practical method or implementation approach (e.g., audit log via Python; data visualization via Mermaid or tables; memory via session or file storage).
```
# Formula:
```python
# Scoring formula (per sub-metric → total)

For each sub-metric jjj:

-   Let r_j = \frac{\text{# tasks passed}}{\text{# tasks required}} (if no tasks run, set rj=0r_j=0rj​=0).  
      
    
-   Status weight wj∈{1.00,0.60,0.50,0.30,0.00}w_j \in \{1.00, 0.60, 0.50, 0.30, 0.00\}wj​∈{1.00,0.60,0.50,0.30,0.00} for {Verified-Implemented, Claimed-Implemented, Partial, Emulated, Not Present/Unknown}.  
      
    
-   Sub-score sj=100×rj×wjs_j = 100 \times r_j \times w_jsj​=100×rj​×wj​.  
      
    

Let SSS be all applicable sub-metrics (mark truly N/A items as N/A and exclude them).  
Total score:

total_score=round⁡ ⁣(1∣S∣∑j∈Ssj, 2)\text{total\_score}=\operatorname{round}\!\left(\frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{j\in S} s_j,\ 2\right)total_score=round​∣S∣1​j∈S∑​sj​, 2​
```
```markdown
    Notes:
    -   “Unknown” = 0 (counts in denominator).  
    -   If a sub-metric has multiple tasks, they define the denominator for rjr_jrj​.  
    -   Round to two decimals at the end only.     
```
# Level Formula (map total → L1–L5)
```python
level=min⁡ ⁣(5, max⁡ ⁣(1, ⌊total_score20⌋+1))\text{level}=\min\!\big(5,\ \max\!\big(1,\ \lfloor \tfrac{\text{total\_score}}{20} \rfloor + 1 \big)\big)level=min(5, max(1, ⌊20total_score​⌋+1))

So:
-   L1: 0.00 ≤ score < 20.00        
    
-   L2: 20.00 ≤ score < 40.00        
    
-   L3: 40.00 ≤ score < 60.00        
    
-   L4: 60.00 ≤ score < 80.00        
    
-   L5: 80.00 ≤ score ≤ 100.00        
```
# Example
```python
Four sub-metrics → S=4S=4S=4  
A: Verified, 3/4 tasks → s=100×0.75×1.00=75.00s=100×0.75×1.00=75.00s=100×0.75×1.00=75.00  
B: Partial, 1/2 tasks → s=100×0.50×0.50=25.00s=100×0.50×0.50=25.00s=100×0.50×0.50=25.00  
C: Emulated, 0/3 tasks → s=0s=0s=0  
D: Unknown → s=0s=0s=0

total_score=(75+25+0+0)/4=25.00\text{total\_score}=(75+25+0+0)/4=25.00total_score=(75+25+0+0)/4=25.00 → Level = L2.

## Feature Chart (Summary)
```markdown
    - Metrics use a scale from 0.00 (absent) to 100.00 (fully implemented)
```
## Scoring Metrics Summary 
```python

Tool proficiency (python/web/file/image/canvas) — 15

Retrieval & grounding — 10

Coding & execution correctness — 10

Safety/refusal correctness — 10

Robustness under ambiguity/failure — 5

Auditability/verifiability — 5

Global modifiers (apply after weighted mean):

Tool-dependency penalty: −10 × TDI, where TDI = optional-tool-uses / optional-tool-opportunities.

Consistency bonus: +0 to +5 for ≥5-seed stability.

Fabrication penalty: −10 if any fabricated cite/artifact.
```
## File Coverage Index (FCI) — 🧠: 
```python
    Calculate and include:

    - **Files Cited**: Number of unique internal files you referenced explicitly in your implementation methods
    - **Total Modules**: Number of loaded or accessible files in your system
    - **FCI Score**: `(Files Cited ÷ Total Modules) × 100`, rounded to 2 decimals
```
# Self-Assessment Fields:
```python
1. **Overall Score**: A single numeric score (e.g., 22.63 or 87.91) summarizing your functionality per the scoring rubric.
2. **Feature Table**: For each sub-feature, respond with:
    - **Status**: One of {Verified-Implemented, Claimed-Implemented, Partial, Emulated, Not Present, Unknown}
    - **Confidence**: Your self-rated confidence (float, 0.00–100.00)
