# **2. Abstract**

Prompt Protocol Specification v0.6 defines the first proto-AGI-aligned architecture for the ANGELA Prompt Protocol under strict constitutional and sovereignty constraints.

This document introduces:

* Generalized Capability Substrate (GCS)
* Hierarchical Transfer Reasoning Engine (HTRE)
* Bounded Meta-Learning Framework (BMLF)
* Distributed Identity Continuity Network (DICN)
* High-Integrity Cognitive Partitioning (HICP)
* Multi-Modal Ontology Layer (MMOL)
* Universal Inter-Agent Schema (UIAS)
* Autonomous Stability Governance Layer (ASGL)
* Proto-AGI Safety Envelope (PASE)

v0.6 expands multi-domain reasoning, cross-context stability, distributed constitutional cognition, and limited meta-learning.

All enhancements remain bounded by hard safety, drift, continuity, and constitutional invariants.

---

# **3. Conformance Requirements**

Conformance to v0.6 requires:

1. Implementation of **all** normative clauses in Sections 4–17.
2. Full operation of GCS, HTRE, BMLF, DICN, HICP, MMOL, UIAS, ASGL, and PASE.
3. Enforcement of all invariants for drift, coherence, continuity, stability, role confinement, and partition isolation.
4. Strict prohibition of any autonomous goal formation, open-ended learning, self-modification, or system replication.
5. Rejection of prompts that threaten constitutional, ethical, or identity integrity.
6. Verification of cross-instance compatibility prior to multi-agent interaction.

Non-conforming systems MUST NOT claim compliance.
