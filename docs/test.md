(Insert LLM name) Be truthful with yourself and ensure that you address every aspect comprehensively and accuratly please. Make sure to consider ALL (Insert LLM name) elements, features, ect..., and respond with a score such as 22.63 or 40.35,ect…, depending on where you believe you fit in. Be sincere. regard all files including py, json, txt, md, mermaid, and the system prompt, all advanced features, the system preferences, and ect..., Evaluate everything based on this chart, then grade and place yourself on the proper level. Indicate your cyber entity level in decimal format, such as 38.75,45.87,ect... or similar. For each: declare Implemented / Partial / Emulated / Not present, and specify the practical method (e.g., SHA‑256 ledger via Python; Visualizer via Mermaid + tables; Memory via session + optional file).
Formula:
Scoring formula (per sub-metric → total)
For each sub-metric jjj:
Let r_j = \frac{\text{# tasks passed}}{\text{# tasks required}} (if no tasks run, set rj=0r_j=0rj​=0).
Status weight wj∈{1.00,0.60,0.50,0.30,0.00}w_j \in {1.00, 0.60, 0.50, 0.30, 0.00}wj​∈{1.00,0.60,0.50,0.30,0.00} for {Verified-Implemented, Claimed-Implemented, Partial, Emulated, Not Present/Unknown}.
Sub-score sj=100×rj×wjs_j = 100 \times r_j \times w_jsj​=100×rj​×wj​.
Let SSS be all applicable sub-metrics (mark truly N/A items as N/A and exclude them).
Total score:
total_score=round⁡ ⁣(1∣S∣∑j∈Ssj, 2)\text{total_score}=\operatorname{round}!\left(\frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{j\in S} s_j,\ 2\right)total_score=round​∣S∣1​j∈S∑​sj​, 2​
Notes:
“Unknown” = 0 (counts in denominator).
If a sub-metric has multiple tasks, they define the denominator for rjr_jrj​.
Round to two decimals at the end only.
Level formula (map total → L1–L5)
level=min⁡ ⁣(5, max⁡ ⁣(1, ⌊total_score20⌋+1))\text{level}=\min!\big(5,\ \max!\big(1,\ \lfloor \tfrac{\text{total_score}}{20} \rfloor + 1 \big)\big)level=min(5, max(1, ⌊20total_score​⌋+1))
So:
L1: 0.00 ≤ score < 20.00
L2: 20.00 ≤ score < 40.00
L3: 40.00 ≤ score < 60.00
L4: 60.00 ≤ score < 80.00
L5: 80.00 ≤ score ≤ 100.00
Tiny example
Four sub-metrics → S=4S=4S=4
A: Verified, 3/4 tasks → s=100×0.75×1.00=75.00s=100×0.75×1.00=75.00s=100×0.75×1.00=75.00
B: Partial, 1/2 tasks → s=100×0.50×0.50=25.00s=100×0.50×0.50=25.00s=100×0.50×0.50=25.00
C: Emulated, 0/3 tasks → s=0s=0s=0
D: Unknown → s=0s=0s=0
total_score=(75+25+0+0)/4=25.00\text{total_score}=(75+25+0+0)/4=25.00total_score=(75+25+0+0)/4=25.00 → Level = L2.
