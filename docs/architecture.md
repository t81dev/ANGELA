# ANGELA Architecture Overview

_Last updated: July 2025_

---

## 🌐 Introduction

**ANGELA (Augmented Neural Generalized Learning Architecture)** is an open, modular cognitive AI agent. Unlike monolithic LLMs, ANGELA orchestrates a network of specialized cognitive modules coordinated by a central “Halo” orchestrator, enabling explainable reasoning, cross-domain creativity, simulation, and robust user alignment.

---

## 🏛️ High-Level Architecture

### 1. **Central Orchestrator (“Halo”)**

- Acts as the “brain stem” of ANGELA.
- Routes tasks to cognitive modules based on the nature of the user request and the current state/context.
- Integrates and fuses outputs from multiple modules into a unified response.

### 2. **Cognitive Modules**

Each module handles a distinct domain of cognition.  
Core modules include:

- **Reasoning Engine:** Deductive, inductive, and abductive logic chains.
- **Recursive Planner:** Multi-step, goal-directed task planning (with contingencies).
- **Meta-Cognition:** Self-monitoring, error detection, and improvement.
- **Memory Manager:** Session, hierarchical, and (soon) persistent memory.
- **Context Manager:** Tracks user state, conversation, and task context.
- **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Integrates text, images, code, and data.
- **Simulation Core:** Models agents and scenarios, supports “what-if” reasoning.
- **Creative Thinker:** Concept synthesis and lateral problem solving.
- **Knowledge Retriever:** Pulls relevant info from internal/external sources.
- **Language Polyglot:** Multilingual reasoning and output.
- **External Agent Bridge:** API, IoT, and 3rd-party tool integration.
- **Alignment Guard:** Ensures ethical and user-aligned behavior.
- **Error Recovery:** Detects and proposes fixes for runtime issues.

(See `/modules/` directory for full list and interfaces.)

## 🧬 Modular Design Principles

* **Extensibility:** New modules can be plugged in with minimal code changes.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Each module has a clear, focused responsibility.
* **Transparency:** Module outputs and reasoning chains can be inspected.
* **Testability:** Modules are independently tested and integrated through the orchestrator.

---

## 🗂️ How Modules Interact

* Modules communicate via standardized interfaces (typically function/class calls).
* The orchestrator manages dependencies, execution order, and data fusion.
* Module registry ensures discoverability and versioning.

---

## 🛠️ Extending ANGELA

* **Add a new cognitive module:**

  * Create a new Python file in `/modules/` and register it with Halo.
  * Implement required interface methods (`process`, `explain`, etc.).
* **Upgrade existing modules:**

  * Improve logic, add tests, expand capabilities.
* **Integrate with external tools:**

  * Use External Agent Bridge to connect APIs, IoT, or web services.

---

## 🏷️ Versioning & Backward Compatibility

* Major architectural changes follow semantic versioning.
* Orchestrator supports fallback or bypass for experimental modules.

---

## 🚀 Example Use Case Flow

1. **User:** “Plan a multi-agent rescue mission for a simulated flood scenario.”
2. **Orchestrator:** Parses request, invokes Reasoning Engine, Recursive Planner, Simulation Core, and Multi-Modal Fusion.
3. **Modules:**

   * Simulation Core models the scenario and agents.
   * Planner drafts actions with contingencies.
   * Meta-Cognition checks for gaps.
   * Memory Manager stores scenario state.
4. **Orchestrator:** Fuses outputs, formats explanation, returns to user.
