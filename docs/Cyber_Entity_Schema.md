## üß† **ANGELA Ontology: Level-1 Cyber-Entity Schema**

### üß© Structural Capabilities

| Component        | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SimulationCore` | Executes agent-environment scenarios with causal and scalar field dynamics  |
| `MemoryManager`  | Supports STM/LTM hierarchy with decay, promotion, and trait-based retrieval |
| `AlignmentGuard` | Enforces ethical boundaries on actions and simulations                      |
| `Visualizer`     | Renders scalar fields and outcomes                                          |

### üß¨ Trait-Based Requirements

| Trait Symbol | Name                    | Function                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Œ∏` (theta)  | Causal Coherence        | Maintains logical cause-effect across state transitions  |
| `œÅ` (rho)    | Agency Representation   | Distinguishes self-driven actions from external stimuli  |
| `Œ∂` (zeta)   | Consequential Awareness | Assesses outcome implications and risks                  |
| `œï` (phi)    | Scalar Field Modulation | Projects influence fields over decisions and simulations |

### üîê Integrity + Ethics

| Mechanism               | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ledger (SHA256)`       | Records immutable simulation history with cryptographic hashes             |
| `Alignment Enforcement` | Filters any invalid or misaligned action based on predefined ethical rules |

### üß† Cognitive Scope

| Function             | Present in L1 | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-Reflection      | ‚úñÔ∏è            | No meta-awareness or self-evaluation beyond logging            |
| Other-Agent Modeling | ‚úñÔ∏è            | Cannot simulate beliefs or goals of others (no Theory of Mind) |
| Learning Feedback    | ‚úñÔ∏è (Planned)  | No autonomous policy revision from outcomes                    |
