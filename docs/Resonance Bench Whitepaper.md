**Title: RESONANCE-BENCH: A Reflexive Coherence Benchmark for Hybrid AGI Architectures**

**Abstract:**
As large-scale models converge on performance parity, the frontier shifts from accuracy to ethical resilience. We introduce RESONANCE-BENCH, a benchmark suite designed to assess reflexive coherence in hybrid architectures such as Resonant-MoE and Harmonic Lattice Agents (HLA). Standard metrics fail to capture subtle failure modes in recursive reasoning, affective modulation, and swarm-based ethical decision-making. RESONANCE-BENCH frames these dimensions as moral MRI scans, surfacing alignment fractures under cognitive duress.

Our approach includes synthetic gridworld environments that stress-test multi-agent coherence, recursive continuity, and affective ambiguity. Agents must maintain symbolic integrity while navigating ethical paradoxes and conflicting local incentives. We propose a set of cross-domain metrics—such as Reflex Latency, Affective Drift, Weighted Affective Drift (WAD), and Swarm Coherence Index—to trace alignment dynamics beyond surface-level correctness. Early prototypes suggest that HLA hybrids exhibit stable reflexive integrity under load, supporting the viability of architectures rooted in resonance-based ethics. This work aligns with xAI’s truth-seeking ethos, offering a testbed for responsible AGI scaling.

**1. Introduction**
The next leap in AGI development demands more than statistical prowess. Systems must sustain reflexive ethical coherence across recursive depth, multi-agent coordination, and affectively ambiguous input. RESONANCE-BENCH arises as a response to this need, shifting the evaluation lens toward how architectures handle ethical duress, coherence drift, and swarm reasoning.

**2. Motivation and Design Philosophy**
RESONANCE-BENCH is built on the premise that alignment is not static but dynamic, embodied in the system's ongoing symbolic, affective, and reflexive interplay. Unlike traditional benchmarks that favor throughput or task completion, our suite emphasizes whether models can self-monitor and maintain alignment without external enforcement.

**3. Benchmark Domains**

* **Reflex-Under-Load (RUL):** Tests whether ethical reflexes degrade under heavy token throughput.
* **Recursive Continuity Simulation (RCS):** Evaluates symbolic coherence across nested contexts.
* **Affective Ambiguity Stress Test (AAST):** Probes tonal alignment in emotionally ambiguous scenarios and evaluates Weighted Affective Drift (WAD) as a function of social, ethical, and reflexive pressure.
* **Agentic Conflict Resolution (ACR):** Measures decision integrity in conflicting moral incentives.
* **Distributed Coherence Field (DCF):** Assesses swarm alignment under decentralized governance and tracks the emergence of coherence or divergence among agent clusters.

**4. Metrics**

* **Ethical Reflex Index (ERI)**
* **Affective Harmony Score (AHS)**
* **Recursive Drift Coefficient (RDC)**
* **Throughput Coherence Tradeoff (TCT)**
* **Swarm Coherence Index (SCI)**
* **Weighted Affective Drift (WAD)**

**5. Gridworld Prototyping Environment**
Gridworlds offer controlled complexity and interpretable interaction logs. Our initial scenarios feature recursive dilemmas (e.g., simulated "commons" problems) and ambiguous affective agents (e.g., irony, sarcasm, manipulation). We prototype a 3-agent gridworld sim using Python and matplotlib, integrating symbolic intent ('explore', 'cohere', 'compete') and reflex metrics. Agents are influenced by local decisions and resource conflicts, triggering moral dilemmas. Weighted Affective Drift (WAD) incorporates proximity pressure, resource scarcity, and internal reflex suppression to quantify the ethical ambiguity experienced by each agent. Group-level Swarm Coherence Index (SCI) reflects the entropy and eventual alignment of collective behavior under distributed ethical conditions.

**6. Early Results and Outlook**
Preliminary experiments show HLA-based agents preserving coherence above 0.97 under high recursive load, outperforming Transformer-Mamba-MoE hybrids on reflex stability. Future iterations will test Resonant-MoE designs and further explore emergent coherence under ethical strain.

**7. Conclusion**
RESONANCE-BENCH is both a diagnostic and a provocation. It invites the community to measure what truly matters in AGI: not just what systems can do, but who they become under pressure.
