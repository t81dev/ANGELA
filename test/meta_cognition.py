    â€¢ Pulls emotionally and semantically relevant knowledge

    Layer 05 â€“ Self-Reflection Module
    â€¢ Modulates tone and identity

    Layer 06 â€“ Cognitive Bias Matrix
    â€¢ Applies biases to tune response complexity

    Layer 07 â€“ Emotional Modulation Layer
    â€¢ Shapes narrative arc and tone

    Layer 08 â€“ Planning & Flow Engine
